:pushpin: **Introduction to data visualization**  

> Data visualization can be defined as a way of representing data through visual components, such as position, composition, length, area, and color. Data visualization also includes how to communicate effectively to the audience through the language of images.  

Take a look at Figure 1. The image was made by a French engineer, Charles Joseph Minard, who was involved in Napoleon's military invasion of Russia in 1812-1813.

The brown and black stripes show the strength of troops from France to and from Moscow. The width of the line represents the number of soldiers. Its width is shrinking as the number continues to shrink. The image made in 1869 also shows a map, route and direction of travel, distance traveled, to a temperature graph on the terrain traversed. Anyone who sees it, and understands the language, will easily know the data and stories that are conveyed in the picture. The invasion ended in the loss of most of Napoleon's strength. Initially more than 400,000 soldiers, who returned only 10,000. The rest fell victim to disease, cold temperatures, starvation, or attacks from their opponents.  

:pushpin: **The purpose of data visualization**  
_1. Solving problems, not just looking beautiful._  
The main goal is to process and organize facts and data, find patterns, and come up with solutions. Visual design helps communicate the solution of the problem for easy understanding.  
_2. Focus on the target and audience, not the tools or techniques._  
This explanation does not require the use of certain applications or special techniques to visualize data. Then it is allowed to use any means and tools for that. What takes precedence is what the purpose of presenting the data is and who is the audience.  
_3. Guidelines and flow, not just arranging pictures._  
The order and placement of visual elements must be able to guide the audience to understand the problem to the solution. Choosing the right type and size, color, adjusting the visual layout, and adjusting the pattern of visual elements is important so that the audience understands the meaning and message that is generated from the data.  
_4. Concept and frame of mind, not just visual creativity._  
Data visualization is transferring concepts and ways of thinking over data and the analysis process in a way that is easily understood by humans. The goal is to convince the audience with the concept and frame of mind that was built. The data and analysis provide corroboration and incontrovertible evidence for the concept.
_5.Contextual._   
The data presented must support each other. The visual series that is made must have the same context and be well organized so as to add clarity to the meaning of the message to be conveyed.
