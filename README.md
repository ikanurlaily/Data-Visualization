:pushpin: **Introduction to data visualization**  

> Data visualization can be defined as a way of representing data through visual components, such as position, composition, length, area, and color. Data visualization also includes how to communicate effectively to the audience through the language of images.  

Take a look at Figure 1. The image was made by a French engineer, Charles Joseph Minard, who was involved in Napoleon's military invasion of Russia in 1812-1813.

The brown and black stripes show the strength of troops from France to and from Moscow. The width of the line represents the number of soldiers. Its width is shrinking as the number continues to shrink. The image made in 1869 also shows a map, route and direction of travel, distance traveled, to a temperature graph on the terrain traversed. Anyone who sees it, and understands the language, will easily know the data and stories that are conveyed in the picture. The invasion ended in the loss of most of Napoleon's strength. Initially more than 400,000 soldiers, who returned only 10,000. The rest fell victim to disease, cold temperatures, starvation, or attacks from their opponents.
